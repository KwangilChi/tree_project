    "\n",
    "df.head()\n",
    "- Returns the first five rows of the dataframe\n",

    "- Returns the last five rows of the dataframe\n",
    "df.head(10)\n",
    "- Returns the last 10 rows of the dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "### .info and .shape\n",
    "df.info()\n",
    "- Provides the essential details about your dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, the number of non-null values, what type of data is in each column, and how much memory your DataFrame is using.\n",
    "\n",
    "df.shape\n",
    "- Returns just a tuple of (rows, columns):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duplicates\n",
    "copy_df = df.append(df)\n",
    "- .append() Return a copy without affecting the original DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "copy_df = copy_df.drop_duplicates()\n",
    "- .drop_duplicates() returns a copy of the dataset, without affecting the original, but with duplicate rows removed\n",
    "\n",
    "copy_df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n",
    "- inplace=True will modify the DataFrame object in place. In other words copy_df **will** have the transformed data automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "copy_df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True, keep=first)\n",
    "copy_df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True, keep=last)\n",
    "copy_df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True, keep=False)\n",
    "- The argument keep for drop_duplicates() has 3 options:\n",
    "1) first: (default) drop duplicates for the first occurence\n",
    "2) last: drop duplicates except for the last occurrence.\n",
    "3) False: drop all duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Columns\n",
    "df.columns\n",
    "- Returns the column labels of the dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "df.rename(columns={\n",
    "        'Original_label_1': 'New_label_1', \n",

    "\n",
    "+ What's with this axis=1 parameter?\n",
    "+ It's not immediately obvious where axis comes from and why you need it to be 1 for it to affect columns. To see why, just look at the .shape output:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ df.shape\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Out: (# of rows, # of columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ As we learned above, this is a tuple that represents the shape of the DataFrame, i.e. 1000 rows and 11 columns. Note that the rows are at index zero of this tuple and columns are at index one of this tuple. This is why axis=1 affects columns. This comes from NumPy, and is a great example of why learning NumPy is worth your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation (replacement of nulls with non-null values)\n",
    "- There may be instances where dropping every row with a null value removes too big a chunk from your dataset, so instead we can impute that null with another value, usually the mean or the median of that column.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Extract the column from which you want to impute missing values\n",
    "column_1 = df['column_label']\n",
    "- Create a variable containing the replacing value (in this case this is the mean value)\n",

    "df.describe()\n",
    "- Returns a summary of the distribution of continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "df['column_label'].describe()\n",
    "- .describe() can also be used on a categorical variable to get the count of rows, unique count of categories, top category, and freq of top category.\n",
    "\n",
    "df['column_label'].value_counts().head(10)\n",
    "- Returns the frequency of first 10 values values in the column, 'column_label'.\n",
    "\n",
    "df.corr()\n",
    "- Returns the relationship between each continuous variable. Correlation tables are a numerical representation of the bivariate relationships in the dataset. Positive numbers indicate a positive correlation — one goes up the other goes up — and negative numbers represent an inverse correlation — one goes up the other goes down. 1.0 indicates a perfect correlation.\n",

    "### Applying functions\n",
    "df[\"new_column\"] = df[\"ref_column\"].apply(function)\n",
    "- Creates a new column (\"new_column\") and places values in this new column according to the function set out by .apply().\n",
    "\n",
    "df[\"new_column\"] = movies_df[\"ref_column\"].apply(lambda x: 'value1' if x >= 8.0 else 'value2')\n",
    "- The .apply() method passes every value in the \"ref_column\" through the function hen returns a new Series. This Series is then assigned to a new column called \"new_column\". In this case, if the value (x) in \"ref_column\" is greater than or equal to 8, \"value1\" is newly assigned. Otherwise, \"value2\" is newly assigned.  \n",

    "## Brief Plotting\n",
    "Another great thing about pandas is that it integrates with Matplotlib, so you get the ability to plot directly off DataFrames and Series. To get started we need to import Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)\n",

    "- Plots histogram with values in column_1 and with a title, 'Column 1'. \n",
